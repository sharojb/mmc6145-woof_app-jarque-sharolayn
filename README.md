## Why this app?

The purpose of this application is to provide users with an easy and intuitive way to search for dog details based on their breed. The app is a single page application that enables users to quickly and easily search for specific dog breeds and view details such as energy, height, weight, and more. It is designed to be accessible and user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to find the information they need quickly and easily.

The inspiration for this application came from a love of dogs and a desire to provide a useful resource for dog owners. There are many benefits into understanding your dog. I noticed that there was a lack of easily accessible information on dog breeds, and that many people were struggling to find the information they needed.

In addition, I wanted to create an application that was responsive and mobile-friendly, so that users could access it from anywhere and on any device.

The front-end of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used a popular front-end framework like React.js to build the user interface, as well as a RESTful API to fetch the dog details data from a database.
